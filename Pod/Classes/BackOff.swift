 BackOff protocol which is used to run the code.
 */
public protocol BackOff {

	/**
	 Populate this method with your code which should be run
	 repeatedly until it succeeds or until `MaxElapsedTimeMillis` exceeds

	 codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting
	 ---

	 If you implement this protocol you must make sure to call `codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting(success:)` in order for the ExponentialBackOff to work properly.

	 This must be done like this because most likely you want to call Networking functions which are mostly called asynchronously with passing a closure as the _result action_.

	 Because you can't know what is happening while this asynchronous task, you should make sure to implement `codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting(result:)` into the _result closure_.

	 For example with Reachability it could look a little bit like this:

	 ```
	 reachability.whenReachable = { reachability in
	 if reachability.isReachableViaWiFi() {
	 codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting(success: true)

	 // Alamofire.request...
	 // ...
	 }

	 reachability.whenUnreachable = { reachability in
	 codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting(success: false)
	 }
	 ```

	 With `codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting(success:)` ExponentialBackOff knows whether it should run another attempt or not. If you don't implement this, the BackOff won't work.

	 - parameter codeToRunAfterFinishedExecuting: Call after your code finished executing and you know the result
